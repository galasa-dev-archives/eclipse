The eclipse code is no longer being maintained. 
Release 0.31.0 was the last release of Galasa to carry the eclipse plugins.
The command line tool `galasactl` can now do everything which eclipse could previously do, so we are removing eclipse plugins.
Eclipse can run a 'terminal' session, in which the command-line tool can be used.
Or you can do the same with Intellij and vscode.
